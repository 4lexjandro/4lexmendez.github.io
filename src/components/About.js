                <p> Hello, my name is Alexjandro Mendoza and I'm currently a student pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science. 
                    I have a passion for investing and would like to take my earnings from
                    my career job to spend on rental properties. I wish I had a mentor in the real estate field but 
                    it seems like I will have to make mistakes on my own and network to meet people.
                    I live in Yonkers and it sucks! However, I am grateful for having a roof over my head. 
                    I'm into video games, food, technology, and I loved speeding on the highway 
                    but these tickets are not fun so my speeding days are over. Check out my highlights for some videos games in the highlights section! If you would like to
                    my resume, download it below üòÅ
